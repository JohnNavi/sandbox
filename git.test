This is my test git file thing.
This file has no purpose except to allow
me to play with git - to see if I can 
'git' a clue.  See what I did there?

Testing the uber -A add stuff.

Testing pushing files to remote repo.

Testing pushing files using SSH instead of https.

Testing integration with eclipse.  Plan is to edit this file - do a local commit and then push the remove repo.
